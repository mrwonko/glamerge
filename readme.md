# GLA Merge

Eventually, this tool is intended to help you copy individual animations from one Jedi Academy .gla animation file to another. Because manually cutting out ranges of frames and calculating the new animation numbers is tedious, and I'd rather write a tool to automate it than a tutorial about how to do it manually. But it is more work this way, and who knows when it will be ready.
